	<h2>2018 Feb 22</h2>

	Flybe plc ("Flybe" or the "Company") (LSE: FLYB) notes the recent media speculation and subsequent announcement made
	by Stobart Group Limited ("Stobart Group"). Flybe confirms that it has not received any approach from Stobart Group
	regarding a possible offer by Stobart Group for Flybe.
	Flybe shareholders are strongly advised to take no action at this stage. There can be no certainty that any firm offer
	will be made nor as to the terms on which any firm offer might be made.

	<h2>2018 Mar 22</h2>
	The Board remains highly confident in the prospects of Flybe and believes that the Group continues to have an exciting
	future as an independent company, delivering the Sustainable Business Improvement Plan as set out in June 2017. This
	plan is focused on driving sustainable profit and cash generation and will see the fleet size reduce to an optimum
	level for the number of identified profitable routes and make the business demand-driven rather than capacity-led.
