                            Mark's tweet raises questions:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Does including the name Cyrus Capital Partners add any additional value to his
                                    story?</li>
                                <li>What was the purpose of mentioning Cyrus Capital Partners?</li>
                                <li>Was this information already in the public domain?</li>
                            </ol>

                            While Flybe, Virgin Atlantic and Stobart are well known brands, the general public is
                            unlikely
                            to be aware of Cyrus Capital Partners. Therefore one can only conclude that the inclusion
                            of
                            the name was for the purpose of identifying the source. The information was already in
                            the public domain - for those that knew what they were looking for.
                            <br /> <br />
                            Published at Companies House back on 18 Dec was the Certificate of Incorporation for Wright
                            Bidco Limited with two company directors along with their occupation:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Lucien Farrell (Partner)</li>
                                <li>Warwick Brady (Chief Executive Officer)</li>
                            </ol>
                            While one can only speculate on who knew what the underlying motive of the company at
                            incorporation was, it is resonable to expect that automated search results were triggered
                            when
                            the company name change was filed earlier today. Without any prior knowledge 8 Hours is
                            more
                            than sufficient to perform internet searches to identify who the directors are.

                            However, Mark failed to mention the name of the new consortium. Would the name of the new
                            airline consortium not be more relevant for the general public?

                            Being a premium listed company divestment worth more than 25% of the market capitalisation
                            requires shareholder approval.<br /><br />
                            This sale represents 31% of yesterday's market capitalisation of &#8776;£8.9m (216,656,776
                            shares, closing price 4.12GBX) Hence the deal will not go through until after the switch in
